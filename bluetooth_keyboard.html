        <h4>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION</h4>
        <p>A wireless keyboard is a computer keyboard that allows the user to communicate with computers, tablets, or laptops with the help of radio frequency, such as WiFi and Bluetooth or with infrared technology. you plug a receiver into one of the USB ports on your computer. The receiver then sends a signal to your battery-powered keyboard. Keep in mind, wireless USB keyboards do have a limited range and some must be within the line of sight of your receiver, depending on the type of signal it uses. Also, if your cordless keyboard starts acting sluggish, it probably requires new batteries. Wireless keyboards present a specific benefit to the consumer. First, wireless USB keyboards reduce wire-clutter on your desk. Also, you aren’t tied to your desk—you can type from your couch, your kitchen table or even while seated on your living room floor! Some keyboards come in a set with a wireless keyboard and mouse. This is an added bonus since computer use is no longer limited to your office.</p>
