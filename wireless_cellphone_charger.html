        <h4>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION</h4>
        <p>Wireless charging lets you charge your smartphone's battery without a cable and plug. Most wireless charging devices take the form of a special pad or surface on which you place your phone to allow it to charge. It uses two resonant inductive couplins to transmit low-power signals between two devices. These are specially designed to transmit electricity without touching each other like a normal wired connection does. The base station, which is plugged into the wall through its own power supply, has a transmitter coil and your phone has a receiver coil. The base station regularly sends a signal out, and when a receiver coil gets close enough, a resonance change (the base station changes the amplitude of its oscillation â€” it vibrates faster) happens in the signal. The waveform of the signal is then modulated (changed to let the coil in the phone know power is being sent) and inductive charging begins.</p>
